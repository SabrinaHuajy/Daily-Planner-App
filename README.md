# Daily-Planner-App

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


In this App I have leveraged many of the skills I've learned so far, I've thought about DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript, integration of third-party APIs, and more. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Moment.js library was used to work with date and time.

The app:

Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

Persist events between refreshes of a page.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
